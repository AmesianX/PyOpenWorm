|pow| Data Sources
==================

The sources of data for PyOpenWorm are stored under the `OpenWormData/aux_data
directory <https://github.com/openworm/PyOpenWorm/tree/5cc3042b004f167dbf18acc119474ea48b47810d/OpenWormData/aux_data>`_.

These data sources are brought into PyOpenWorm by means of the
`insert_worm.py script <https://github.com/openworm/PyOpenWorm/blob/5cc3042b004f167dbf18acc119474ea48b47810d/OpenWormData/scripts/insert_worm.py>`_, which shows exactly how a given kind of data is
brought into the system.  For example `this method <https://github.com/openworm/PyOpenWorm/blob/5cc3042b004f167dbf18acc119474ea48b47810d/OpenWormData/scripts/insert_worm.py#L37>`_ shows where data about muscles
comes from, while `this method <https://github.com/openworm/PyOpenWorm/blob/5cc3042b004f167dbf18acc119474ea48b47810d/OpenWormData/scripts/insert_worm.py#L218>`_ shows where the connectivity data comes from.
A more detailed human readable key is provided below.

A Note on |pow| Data
--------------------
Below, each major element of the worm's anatomy that |pow| stores data
on is considered individually. The data being used is tagged by source
in a superscript, and the decisions made during the curation process
(if any) are described.

Neurons
-------

- Cell descriptions [2]_
- Lineage names [2]_
- Neuron names [5]_
- Neuron types [3]_
- Neurotransmitters [8]_

Muscle cells
------------

- Cell descriptions [2]_
- Lineage names [2]_
- Muscle names [5]_
- Neurons that innervate each muscle [6]_

Connectome
----------

- Gap junctions [6]_
- Synapses [6]_

Curation note
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There is another source of C. *elegans* connectome data that was created
by members of the OpenWorm project. The history of this spreadsheet is
mostly contained in
`this forum post <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/openworm-discuss/G9wKoR8N-l0/discussion>`_
We decided to use the WormAtlas spreadsheet [4]_ as the authoritative source
for connectome data, as it was not processed by members of OpenWorm, and
appears on a reference site (WormAtlas).
